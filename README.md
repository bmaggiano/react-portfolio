## Description

React is one of the most popular Javascript based technologies on the market right now, and being confident in the ability to make react applications is a highly sought after skill. This portfolio is made with React and it allows potential future employers to sample my work, get a feel for who I am, download my resume, and in the future... be able to directly submit contact forms that will link to my email. At the moment this is purely a front end application that have links to take the user to different pages, and also links to take the user to different projects of mine.
